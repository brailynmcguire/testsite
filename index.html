    <h1>This is a Cat</h1>

        This is not my cat. I found this one on Google. I don't have a cat but I would like to 
    own one someday. Both my dad and my sister are allegric, hence no cat. My family currently just has a dog.
    One of my friends recently got a cat. She used to have another cat, but he got run over by a car. It was very sad.

        I have another friend who has three cats! Her family also has a dog. They also used to have rats as pets. 
    I don't think that I would ever have a pet rat, but I think it's cool that her family has had such a wide variety of
    pets. I also respect the fact that they are able to manage four pets at once.

        These are the names of my friends' cats, past and future:

        <li>Ziggy</li>
        <li>Duke</li>
        <li>Maggie</li>
    </ul>
